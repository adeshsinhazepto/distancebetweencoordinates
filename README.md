# Length of the line: 
This program is designed to calculate the distance between two points in a 2D space. The coordinates of the points are provided by the user.

# How to Use
Run the program.
When prompted, enter the coordinates of the first point seperated by space. Input the x-coordinate and press enter, then input the y-coordinate and press enter.
Repeat the process for the second point.
The program will then calculate and display the distance between the two points.

# How to Run
1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the program.
4. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure all the dependencies are in place.
5. Run the program using the command `go run main.go` inside the cmd/length folder.
6. Follow the prompts to input the coordinates of the two points.cd 

# How to Test
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the tests using the command `go test ./...'

# Function
 1. Distance()-Calculate distance between two points using distance formulae
 2. NewPoint()- To make point as a struct

 # Requirements
